 ###   A Bit More About Me
Before switching to tech, I worked as a Vet and teacher for 10 years‚Äîa background that shaped my strong communication, problem-solving, and empathy skills.  
I bring those strengths into tech, where I care deeply about user experience, team collaboration, and continuous learning.
